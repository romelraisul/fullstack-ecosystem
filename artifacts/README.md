# Benchmark Artifacts Directory

JSON outputs from `benchmark_metrics_quantiles.py` and aggregate markdown/JSON summaries live here by default.

Ignored patterns include individual JSON/Markdown files to prevent repository bloat. Curate any important historical snapshots by moving them to a different tracked folder (e.g., `benchmarks_history/`).

        with:
          name: docker-image
          path: fullstack-ecosystem.tar

  deploy:
    needs: build-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Download Docker image artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: docker-image
      - name: Load Docker image
        run: |
          docker load < fullstack-ecosystem.tar
      # Add your deployment step here (e.g., push to registry, SSH to server, etc.)
      # Example: docker tag/push or docker-compose up
      - name: Deploy (placeholder)
        run: echo "Deploy step goes here."
```

## How to Extend
- Add secrets for Docker registry or server credentials as needed.
- Replace the deploy step with your actual deployment logic (e.g., push to ECR/GCR, SSH deploy, Azure Web App, etc.).
- For Azure, use the `azure/webapps-deploy` action.

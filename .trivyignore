# Trivy ignore file (HIGH/CRITICAL still fail unless suppressed here)
# Add vulnerability IDs (e.g. CVE-2025-12345) one per line.
# Only ignore when:
#  - No fixed version exists yet AND
#  - Exploitability is low or mitigated elsewhere
# Periodically review and remove stale ignores.

# Example placeholders (commented out):
# CVE-2024-99999 # low impact in transitive lib, awaiting upstream patch

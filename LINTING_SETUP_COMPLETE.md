# üéâ Code Quality Tools Successfully Installed

## Overview

Your comprehensive code quality system with pre-commit hooks, type checking (mypy),
linting (ruff/flake8), and formatting (black/ruff format) has been successfully set up and is ready to use!

## üöÄ What's Been Installed

### Pre-commit Hooks

- **Pre-commit**: Automated quality checks that run before each commit
- **Git hooks**: Format, lint, type-check, and test automation

### Tools

- **mypy 1.18.2**: Static type checker with comprehensive configuration and baseline support
- **Ruff 0.13.3**: Modern, fast Python linter with auto-fix capabilities
- **Black**: Opinionated Python code formatter
- **Flake8**: Traditional Python linter for additional coverage

### Configuration Files

- **`pyproject.toml`**: Enhanced with comprehensive ruff and mypy configuration
- **`.flake8`**: Flake8-specific settings with black compatibility
- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`**: Pre-commit hooks configuration for automated quality checks
- **`mypy-baseline.txt`**: Generated baseline of current type issues for gradual improvement
- **Excluded problematic files**: Syntax error files temporarily excluded

### Scripts (Cross-Platform)

- **`scripts/format.py`**: Runs ruff format + ruff --fix + black
- **`scripts/lint.py`**: Runs ruff check + flake8 + mypy
- **`scripts/type_check.py`**: Runs mypy with baseline generation capability
- **`scripts/quality.py`**: Combined formatting + linting + type checking workflow
- **`scripts/setup_pre_commit.py`**: Install and configure pre-commit hooks
- **`scripts/pre_commit_wrapper.py`**: Environment wrapper for Windows encoding issues
- **PowerShell versions**: `format.ps1`, `lint.ps1`, `type_check.ps1`, `quality.ps1`, `setup_pre_commit.ps1`
- **Windows batch**: `quality.bat`

### Makefile Integration

- `make format`: Run formatting
- `make lint`: Run linting
- `make type-check`: Run type checking
- `make type-baseline`: Generate mypy baseline
- `make quality`: Run formatting, linting, and type checking
- `make pre-commit-install`: Install pre-commit hooks
- `make pre-commit-run`: Run pre-commit on all files
- `make pre-commit-update`: Update pre-commit hook versions

## üéØ How to Use

### Pre-commit Workflow (Recommended)

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks (one-time setup)
python scripts/setup_pre_commit.py
# or
.\scripts\setup_pre_commit.ps1

# Now quality checks run automatically on git commit!
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"  # Pre-commit hooks run automatically

# Run pre-commit manually on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run pre-commit on staged files only
pre-commit run
```

### Quick Start (Direct Commands)

```bash
# Run full quality check (format + lint + type check)
python scripts/quality.py

# Or using make
make quality
```

### Individual Tools

```bash
# Format code
python scripts/format.py

# Lint code
python scripts/lint.py

# Type check code
python scripts/type_check.py

# Generate mypy baseline
python scripts/type_check.py --baseline

# Format specific files/directories
python scripts/format.py autogen/
python scripts/lint.py tests/
```

### Auto-fix Issues

```bash
# Auto-fix many issues
python -m ruff check --fix .
python -m black .
```

## üìä Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Perfect

- All tools installed and configured (ruff, black, flake8, mypy)
- Type checking with baseline approach implemented
- Scripts working with proper encoding handling
- Cross-platform compatibility achieved
- Comprehensive configuration in place

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- Some existing files have syntax errors (now excluded)
- Large codebase has many linting issues to address
- Type checking baseline contains current issues for gradual improvement
- Unicode encoding handled in scripts and pre-commit wrapper

### üéØ Next Steps

1. **Set up pre-commit hooks**: Run `python scripts/setup_pre_commit.py` for automated quality checks
2. **Review the output**: Check what issues were found by each tool
3. **Fix gradually**: Address linting and type issues file by file or category by category
4. **Use auto-fix**: Many issues can be automatically fixed with `--fix` flags
5. **Baseline approach**: Use type checking baseline to gradually improve type coverage
6. **Integrate into workflow**: Pre-commit hooks automatically check quality on every commit

## üìù Configuration Highlights

### Ruff Configuration

- Line length: 100 characters
- Target: Python 3.10+
- Rules: E, W, F, I, B, C4, UP, ARG, C90, T20, SIM, ICN
- Auto-fix enabled for many rules
- Per-file ignores for special cases

### Black Configuration

- Line length: 100 characters
- Compatible with ruff settings
- Automatic code formatting

### mypy Configuration

- Line length: 100 characters
- Target: Python 3.10+ with comprehensive type checking
- Strict mode: Enabled with per-module overrides for gradual adoption
- Baseline approach: Uses `mypy-baseline.txt` for tracking existing issues
- Type stubs: Included for external libraries (requests, PyYAML)

### Pre-commit Configuration

- **Format**: Runs ruff format and ruff --fix on commit
- **Lint**: Runs ruff check for code quality issues
- **Type check**: Runs mypy for type safety
- **Built-in hooks**: Trailing whitespace, end-of-file, merge conflicts, YAML/JSON validation
- **Security**: Bandit for security issue detection
- **Performance**: Only runs on changed files by default

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Pre-commit Issues

If pre-commit hooks fail to install or run:

```bash
# Reinstall pre-commit hooks
pre-commit uninstall
python scripts/setup_pre_commit.py

# Check hook status
pre-commit --version
git config --list | grep pre-commit

# Clear pre-commit cache
pre-commit clean
```

### Encoding Errors

The scripts now handle encoding properly, but if issues persist:

```bash
set PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
python scripts/quality.py
```

### If you want to include excluded files

Edit the `exclude` list in `pyproject.toml` and `.flake8` to remove files you've fixed.

### To run with more aggressive fixes

```bash
python -m ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes .
```

## üìö Documentation

Complete documentation available in:

- `README-CODE-QUALITY.md`: Comprehensive setup and usage guide (300+ lines)
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Pre-commit hook configuration with comments
- `scripts/setup_pre_commit.py`: Automated setup with detailed help

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Your linting, formatting, and pre-commit hook setup is ready for production use!

**Time to Quality**: The infrastructure is in place. Pre-commit hooks will automatically maintain
code quality, and you can gradually improve your codebase using these tools.

Happy coding! üöÄ‚ú®
